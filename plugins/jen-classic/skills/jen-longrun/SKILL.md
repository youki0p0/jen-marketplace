# Jen Longrun (v3 / Fable)

Use Jen PMO long-running cycle. Main session should run on Claude Fable 5 (`/model fable`),
which sustains multi-day autonomous loops. Delegate execution to cheaper worker agents;
escalate only through haiku → sonnet → opus → fable (jen-deep-solver).

1. Create/update `.jen/mission.md` with Goal, Non-goals, Constraints, AC, Human Gates.
2. Create/update `.jen/tasks.json`.
3. Work in small cycles.
4. Delegate implementation to specialists.
5. Run quality gates.
6. Repair failures up to 3 loops.
7. Update `.jen/handoff.md` after each cycle.
8. Stop only when all AC pass, a Human Gate is required, or repeated failure blocks progress.

Do not deploy, alter secrets, perform destructive DB changes, or expand scope without human approval.
